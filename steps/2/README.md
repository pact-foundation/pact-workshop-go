## Step 2 - Client Tested but integration fails

Now lets create a basic test for our API client. We're going to check 2 things:

1. That our client code hit the expected endpoint
1. That the response is marshalled into a `User` object, with the correct ID

_consumer/client/client_test.go_

```go
func TestClientUnit_GetUser(t *testing.T) {
	userID := 10

	// Setup mock server
	server := httptest.NewServer(http.HandlerFunc(func(rw http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
		assert.Equal(t, req.URL.String(), fmt.Sprintf("/user/%d", userID))
		user, _ := json.Marshal(model.User{
			FirstName: "Sally",
			LastName:  "McDougall",
			ID:        userID,
			Type:      "admin",
			Username:  "smcdougall",
		})
		rw.Write([]byte(user))
	}))
	defer server.Close()

	// Setup client
	u, _ := url.Parse(server.URL)
	client := &Client{
		BaseURL: u,
	}
	user, err := client.GetUser(userID)
	assert.NoError(t, err)

	// Assert basic fact
	assert.Equal(t, user.ID, userID)
}

```

![Unit Test With Mocked Response](diagrams/workshop_step2_unit_test.png)

Let's run this spec and see it all pass:

```
$ make unit

--- 🔨Running Unit tests
go test -count=1 github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-go/consumer/client -run 'TestClientUnit'
ok  	github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-go/consumer/client	10.196s
```

Meanwhile, our provider team has started building out their API in parallel. Let's run our client against our provider (you'll need two terminals to do this):

```
# Terminal 1
$ make run-provider

2019/10/28 18:24:37 API starting: port 8080 ([::]:8080)

# Terminal 2
make run-consumer

2019/10/28 18:25:57 api unavailable
exit status 1
make: *** [run-consumer] Error 1

```

Doh! The Provider doesn't know about `/users/:id`. On closer inspection, the provider only knows about `/user/:id` and `/users`.

We need to have a conversation about what the endpoint should be, but first...
